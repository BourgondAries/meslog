* bin - The program executables - or library files - are located here  
* doc - Contains the documentation generated by doxygen or another documentation generator  
* ext - External libraries go in here  
* ide - IDE specific files  
* inc - "Include files" created and used in the project  
* rsc - Resources (text, audio, video, textures) are stored here  
* src - Source files (compilable) go in here  
* tmp - Object files, temporaries  

More folders may be added, like version control folders (.git). Make these unofficial folders hidden.  
The folders that should be added to the repository are doc, ext, include, res, src.  
These folders contain the files necessary for compiling the software. bin contain only 
finished binaries. ide contains computer-specific data, so it is unnecessary.  
tmp is also temporary, and is not required for program compilation.  

The root folder should contain the files:

* README.md
* ABOUT.md (this file)
* LICENSE.md

The readme will be the starting point for anyone wanting to read about the project. The readme should contain necessary information for anyone to start getting into the project.  
About, this file, will be about the directory structure and setup.  

The license file contains the license of the project.
